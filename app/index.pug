                p.career-company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) via Lima Bean
                p.career-role NTT is an international technology services company. During my time at NTT, I worked as part of the dev team responsibile for creating micro frontends, integrating their GraphQL data service & interacting with the highcharts api within Angular, using NGRX as a state management tool. The tasks performed contributed to the building of the sleek UI of the "Hardware as a Service" platform NTT had been developing. While my role was predominantly frontend focused I learnt a great deal about querying APIs with GraphQL and deploying mutliple apps independently from the same repository.
