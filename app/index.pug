                p.career-period Mar 2019 - Jul 2019
              p.career-company Lima Bean &mdash; Observatory, Cape Town, ZA
              p.career-role I joined Lima Bean in a team of highly skilled developers, as their most junior member, who guided me to be able to quickly adjust to the competitive and high-quality focused team dynamic. I learnt the great value of writing understandable, maintainable and standard practice abiding code, picking up many skills while on the endeavour to be able to write code of such quality. I spent my first months working on many different projects and as a result have developed the skill of quickly learning new frameworks and patterns and adjusting my style of code to suite the defined standard of the project, while learning to make subtle adjustments to reduce inconsistencies and minor inefficiencies.
              ul.career-points

                li Fixing cross-browser compatitbility issues.
                li Investigating logic failures and data inconsistencies.
                li Assisting in building new functionality.
                li Supporting more senior developers when there is an increased workload.
